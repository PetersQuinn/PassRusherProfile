# PassRusherProfile
An attempt at a series of multiple regressions that analyze the importance of various factors of NFL pass rushers.
This repository contains several projects:
- An included practice file to warm up to multiple regression analysis
- A free agency evaluation model for NFL edge rushers, specifically focused on pass rushers.
- A draft evaluation model set to locate what college stats tend to associate with pass rushers that excel in a given NFL stat.

These models are integral to the adaption of analytics in the NFL.
